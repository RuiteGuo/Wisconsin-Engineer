## Editing for new issue

1. Go to the /current_issue/ folder. Replace those images with images for the new issue.
2. Open the home.html file at /pages/home.html. Change the issue date wherever that is.
3. In the home.html file, find any links going to the current issue, and fix them to go to the new issue. Example: Change any links to http://read.wisconsinengineer.co/tagged/march-2016 to http://read.wisconsinengineer.com/tagged/**new issue date**
